# ScraperJS
- ScraperJS is a JavaScript based web scraper made using Puppeteer Node library.
- The aim of this project is to scrape https://www.startupindia.gov.in website for startup data.

> ScraperJS visits the defined URLs and it clicks on the "Load More" button until the website is fully loaded. 
> Once the website is fully loaded, it then proceeds to fetch the designated data and converts it into JSON string. 
> The final JSON string is then written into .json file.
